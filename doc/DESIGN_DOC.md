## Design Goals

* Goal #1: Modularity and Extensibility
  * The architecture was designed to be very modular, allowing for the easy addition of new components and features without breaking existing functionality. 
  * This modularity makes sure that each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, increasing flexibility and extensibility.
  * Interfaces and abstract classes were implemented to define clear boundaries between modules which allowed for easy substitution/extension of components. For example, the *ExternalGameEngine* interface provided a contract for interaction between the game controller and the game engine, 
  enabling alternative implementations to be integrated seamlessly.

* Goal #2: Configurability 
  * The system was designed to be highly configurable, enabling users to customize various aspects into their own games that they can create in the authoring environment without changing the codebase or writing a line of code. 
  * By abstracting configuration parameters, the system promotes adaptability to diverse game requirements.

* Goal #3: Abstraction of Core Functionality
  * The design emphasizes abstracting core game functionalities (such as the game engine) into reusable components or interfaces. 
  * This abstraction layer separates the high-level game logic from the implementation details.

#### How were Specific Features Made Easy to Add

* Feature #1: New Commands
  * Make a class that implements Command
  * Give annotation with expected parameter number
  * You've just made a new command!

* Feature #2: New UI Elements

* Feature #3: New Turn Policies
  * Make a class that implements Turn Policies
  * You've just made a new turn policy!

#### Features Not Yet Done

* Feature #1: Allowing user to specify surface incline in authoring environment  
  The current authoring environment does not allow users to select the incline of their chosen
  surfaces. There is backend support for surfaces of various angles, which is evident by the
  successful implementation of games like breakout and flappy bird that appear to have downwards
  gravity in relation to the screen.

* Feature #2: Leaderboards with varying stats  
  Currently, the leaderboards displayed show the top scores for the game that was last completed.
  This could be extended to show top scores within friend circles or most frequently played games.

* Feature #3: Consistent UI Theme

* Feature #4
