/**
 * The SnakeTurnPolicy class implements the TurnPolicy interface by defining a turn policy where
 * players take turns in a "snake-like" order (with inspiration from a Fantasy Football snake
 * draft). The policy iterates through the player list in order, alternating whether it iterates
 * forward or backwards with each iteration, and skipping players who have completed their rounds
 * until a player who has yet to complete it is found.
